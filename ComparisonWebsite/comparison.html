                <h3>Controlling Ability</h3>
                <p>When considering the controlling ability of the PC and any console, we must consider all of our options.
                    For the PC, the options are easily exceeding of any other console.  With the availablity of both a keyboard and mouse, certain games can be made
                    with countless different controls to offer complex and intuitive games with easy control.  The mouse is the most precise that one can really get for 
                    (most) video games, especially first person shooters.  The user of a mouse will have AT LEAST 3 buttons alongside the keyboard.  But mice dedicated for video games
                    often have at around 5-8 buttons in convenient locations for the fingers, and sometimes up to 20 (which may be a little excessive). 

                </p>
                <p>
                    As for consoles, the device, whether it be
                    Xbox, Playstation, or a Nintendo Switch, are mainly limited to certain classes of controllers dedicated to their device.  
                    A nintendo switch may offer a few different options, such as the joycons or a gamecube controller, but other than that options become
                    narrow.  The controllers offer an exclusive experience to their associated console, which is nice, but even then, controllers can be used for a PC anyways in some cases.
                    For example, steam controllers, which are similar to Xbox or playstation controllers, can be used for steam games on a PC to open up opportunities for games that may be more suited for controllers.
                    Overall, the personal computer simply has more options when it comes to controlling ability.

                <h3>Game Options</h3>
                <p>
                    In this case, the options for games became exclusive for certain devices.  Many games end up being exclusive to consoles, such as Super Smash Bros Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch.
                    The reason many games, especially Nintendo Games, become so exclusive to their devices is just to have a separate demand for games outside of a PC.  This is unfortunate, but it at least offers
                    a unique experience for the Nintendo Switch, or any console exclusive games for that matter.  

                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the PC still easily has the most options for video games, and furthermore, offers the ability to customize and mod games to the user's content.  
                    And to set consoles aside even further, emulators can be installed on a PC to offer some of the older console limited options, and even some newer.  This includes emulators like the Dolphin Emulator for 
                    the Wii, which opens up the PC community to Nintendo Games on their very own PC anyways.  There are mobile emulators as well, such as Bluestacks, to give PC users the enjoyment of some mobile games if need be.
                    Modding video games also opens up a community of creators within a game, such as with Sandbox games like Garry's Mod, Minecraft or even Terraria (my personal favorite).  With modding, even more content can be added on to games, which on console normally cannot be accomplished at ease.

                <h3>Affordability</h3>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the PC simply loses in this battle, at least if you are looking for the opportunity to play video games at high quality.
                    Purchasing consoles and the games associated with them initally is just much less expensive compared to purchasing a highly capable computer for running
                    high-end games.  Consoles typically lie in the $200-$300 price range, where as a nice PC can be just under $1000 or even more expensive considering all the components and equipment associated
                    with it.  Building a PC with all the necessary components from nothing requires various items such as motherboards, graphics cards, hard drives, cases, coolers, monitors and even more.  
                    A nice headset, smooth mousepad, ergonomic mouse, and great keyboard all add up to the price of a PC considering the expectation of a good gaming experience.  Consoles come pre-made, and work well
                    for their cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing that would set off PC's in their price is after an initial purchase, where perhaps only certain parts for a PC need to be bought to improve the 
                    performance or graphics of the machine.  Alongside this, memberships are usually required for consoles anyways to play online, and when new consoles are releases, old ones simply
                    become outdated quickly.  Free games are also far easier to access on a PC, when considering the internet and the vast array of games from Steam and such.  But other than these factors,
                    the console is simply more affordable.
